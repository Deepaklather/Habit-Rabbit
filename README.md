# Habit-Rabbit
## Project Description:

### Minimal Viable Product
* Users will be able to create/login
* input, remove, and edit habits
* be able to view habits in an agenda layout
	* be able to view Rabbit Hutch, which is filled with rabbits as you complete a habit, but kills the rabbits when you don’t (and notifies the user that they murdered their rabbits)
    
### Add-on features
* sync with other apps to be kept accountable (such as Fitbit, MyFitnessPal, etc)
* push selected habits to google calendar
* users can add “friends” who will be able to shame them when they falsely enter that they did something that they didn’t
* Using paypal, users will be able to bet money that they will complete all their habits for a given period of time. If they fail, the money is donated to a charity of their choice.


## User story:
As a user, I can download this app on my android device to keep track of habits that I wish to make/break, and hold myself accountable. I can enter habits into the app and have them repeat at custom intervals, and edit them later if I want to change the frequency, or delete them altogether eventually. I can view what I need to do for the day in a visually appealing agenda layout. Additionally, Habit Rabbit will guilt me into keeping to my habits by accusing me of "murdering" my virtual rabbits if I do not do what I promised I would.
