# Habit-Rabbit

# Project Description
## MVP:

- Users will be able to create/login their own personal accounts. 
- In each individual's account, users would have the options to create, edit and delete habits on their own wills. 
- A cute little rabbit will be born whenever a habit is created, rabbit's growth is used as a motivation to encourge users to acheive their goals. The rabbit could potentially pass away if users stay in-active for too long. 
- Users would also be able to create notes or alarms for reminders or progress-tracking purposes. 
- The information of notes would be display in calendar or agenda layout.
